        <h1>Vivek Devulapalli</h1>
        <h2>Postdoctoral Researcher at EMPA</h2>
        <p>I’m an early-career postdoctoral researcher with a strong materials science background, specializing in advanced electron microscopy. I investigate materials ranging from metals to semiconductors, using aberration-corrected STEM to connect atomic structure and composition to properties across scales. </p> 
		<p>My work includes multidimensional imaging, analytical techniques, and STEM simulations for in-depth material characterization. I’m passionate about open science and science communication. Currently, I am working on studying deformation mechanics of metals and multilayer thin films using in situ tensile testing.</p>
